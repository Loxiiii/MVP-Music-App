There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Lyric.ly

## Sub-Heading ##
  > For those looking for a deep lyric-annotation tool

## Summary ##
  > This tool has been developed to provide the user with a platform to search and listen to songs while
  they can take notes on the lyrics. You can save your favorite songs, lyrics and the notes you have take them
  and have them persist on a mongoDB based database and share with anyone!

## Problem ##
  > It is hard to find a platform that allows you to write down your thought of different and multiple sections of
  songs while not losing a single beat of the music. Lyric.ly does that.

## Solution ##
  > Lyric.ly allows you to, using it's embedded player, search for music and play it, while displaying the lyrics for
  the song selected and allowing you to take notes on it on the very moment you are experiencing the music. Once you are done,
  you are able to save it to your profile to then be able to revisit, or even share with other users of the platform.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Lyric.ly uncovered a new dimension of entertainment when consuming musical media. If you told me 10 years ago that in 2022,
  humanity would be fighting a global pandemic AND have developed a tool that allows for the most complete and full expression of joy
  through your ears and thought, I would have never believed it. I would recommend Lyric.ly to everyone!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Notice how, right of the bat, Lyric.ly is going to pre load the top 6 songs in the US by using the very latest data available
  in the market. From then, just search a song you want to listen to and annotate, and click on it. Lyrics will display on the bottom
  along with a text editor for you to highlight and type your interpretations. If you want to save these thoughts, just click
  the save button to save them to you profile for you to share or revisit.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Lyric.ly allows me to focus on the music while I let my mind ramble through the different thoughts that the
  artist is provoquing. Truly a unique experience that changed the music consumption game"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Try it out. Enjoy the experience. Share it, and leave your feedback!
