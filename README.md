  > Lyric.ly

## Sub-Heading ##
  > For those looking for a deep lyric-annotation tool

## Summary ##
  > This tool has been developed to provide the user with a platform to search and listen to songs while
  they can take notes on the lyrics. You can save your favorite songs, lyrics and the notes you have take them
  and have them persist on a mongoDB based database and share with anyone!

## Problem ##
  > It is hard to find a platform that allows you to write down your thought of different and multiple sections of
  songs while not losing a single beat of the music. Lyric.ly does that.

## Solution ##
  > Lyric.ly allows you to, using it's embedded player, search for music and play it, while displaying the lyrics for
  the song selected and allowing you to take notes on it on the very moment you are experiencing the music. Once you are done,
  you are able to save it to your profile to then be able to revisit, or even share with other users of the platform.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Lyric.ly uncovered a new dimension of entertainment when consuming musical media. If you told me 10 years ago that in 2022,
  humanity would be fighting a global pandemic AND have developed a tool that allows for the most complete and full expression of joy
  through your ears and thought, I would have never believed it. I would recommend Lyric.ly to everyone!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Notice how, right of the bat, Lyric.ly is going to pre load the top 6 songs in the US by using the very latest data available
  in the market. From then, just search a song you want to listen to and annotate, and click on it. Lyrics will display on the bottom
  along with a text editor for you to highlight and type your interpretations. If you want to save these thoughts, just click
  the save button to save them to you profile for you to share or revisit.

## Customer Quote ##

  artist is provoquing. Truly a unique experience that changed the music consumption game"
